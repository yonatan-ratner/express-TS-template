## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone & Install

```
git clone https://github.com/yonatan-ratner/confluence-integration.git
cd confluence-integration
npm install
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Create an `.env` file:

```env
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
ATLASSIAN_REDIRECT_URL=your-callback-url
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
```

> **Note**: `SESSION_SECRET` is used by `express-session` for token storage, it can be whatever you want as long as it will be unique.

### 3. Build & Run

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

### 4. Debug

requires an existing build so first run

```
npm run build
```

then setup `./vscode/launch.json` like so:

```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [

        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug Typescript",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**"
            ],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}\src\app.ts",
            "runtimeArgs": [ "-r", "ts-node/register", "-r", "tsconfig-paths/register" ],
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "outFiles": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/**/*.js"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Then you can click `F5` to debug, or initiate it manually from the menu.

## 🧪 Testing

- Built-in test structure using **Mocha** and **Chai**

### 🧩 Covered Areas

| Test Type       | Status | Description                                                             |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Unit Tests   | ✅     | Tests for utilities and internal logic (e.g., AuthService, jsonToQuery) |
| ✅ Lint + Build | ✅     | Tests ensure `npm run lint` and `npm run build` succeed                 |
| ✅ Startup Test | ✅     | Verifies that `npm run start` compiles and responds on the `/` route    |
| 🚧 Integration  | 🟡     | Partial testing of service logic and session extensions                 |
| ❌ Full E2E     | ❌     | Skipped due to OAuth2 3LO browser-based flow                            |

### 🔎 Running Tests

```
npm test
```

This runs all tests, which include:

- Linting checks
- Build compilation test
- Startup test (auto-builds if needed)
- All unit & service-level tests

## ⚠️ Limitations & Concessions

This project is a **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** focused on OAuth2 integration and core functionality. To keep the scope tight, the following trade-offs were made:

- 🔐 **No token refresh logic**  
  Access tokens are short-lived. The refresh token flow is not implemented but can be added easily if needed.

- 🧪 **Limited testing coverage**  
  While test structure using Mocha/Chai is set up, only basic unit tests are in place. Coverage for services, route handlers, and error states is still needed.

- 📦 **Package vulnerabilities**  
  As of the last install, `express-session` and `express` have known vulnerabilities (3 low, 4 high). These are acceptable for a PoC, but should be audited and patched in production.

- 🔧 **Magic strings & tight coupling**  
  Strings like OAuth scopes, endpoint paths, and HTML templates are hardcoded. These should ideally be extracted into constants/config files for maintainability and testability.

- 🧭 **Router paths defined inline**  
  Routes are registered inline (`app.use('/')`) which works for small apps but may cause confusion at scale. Grouping or versioning route prefixes can help structure larger APIs.

- 🛠 **No view engine**  
  HTML pages are built via string templates. While visually clean, this approach limits maintainability. Using a templating engine (e.g., EJS or Pug) would scale better for UI rendering.

- 🧠 **No logging or error monitoring**  
  Errors are logged to the console only. A proper logging system (like `winston`) or monitoring tool would be needed for production-readiness.

- 🧰 **No persistent storage**  
  Session data and tokens are held in memory, which resets on server restart. In production, a store like Redis would be essential.
